# Mixed Reality for Motor-Cognitive Stroke Rehabilitation

### Motor rehabilitation: Upper body limb, arm extension and movement
### Cognitive rehabilitation: Information processing, visuospatial memory

This github repo shows my work for my Specialization Project for the Spring 2020 semester. The project aims to contribute to the medical field by using Virtual Reality technology (Unity, Oculus Quest) to make an accessible experience for any stroke patient needing motor-cognitive rehabilitation. A special interest is placed on varying degrees of hand impairment. While this experience does not target hand rehabilitation, it does simulate the experience of pinching/grabbing an object. Therefore, the goal is to have an experience in which this action can be simulated regardless of hand/finger dexterity of the user.
